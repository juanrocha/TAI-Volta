\opening{Dear Editor:}

Please find enclosed the manuscript **"Mapping Social-Ecological Systems Archetypes"** for submission to Nature Sustainability as a research article. The manuscript develops a method for upscaling Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework. Current uses of the SES framework are limited to local scales and their conclusions hardly reach policy making arenas. Here we attempt to use the framework at a binational scale applied to issues of food security in the Volta river basin (Ghana and Burkina Faso).
