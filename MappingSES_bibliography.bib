annote = {"By clearing tropical forest, practicing subsistence agriculture, intesifying farmland production, or expanding urban centers, human actions are changing the world's landscapes in pervasive ways"

"Since 1850, roughly 35% of atropogenic CO2 emissions resulted directly from land use()"

"Land use thus present us with a dilemma. On one hand, many land-use practices are absolutely essential for humanity, because they provide critical natural resources and ecosystem services, such as food, fiber, shelter, and freshwater. On the other hand, some forms of land use are degradating the ecosystems and services upon which we depend, so a natural question arise: Are land-use activities degrading the global environment in ways that may ultimately undermine ecosystem services, human welfare, and the long-term sustainability of human societies?"

"increasing fertilizer use has led to the  degradation of water quality in many regions (). In addition, some irrigated lands have become heavily salinized, causing the worldwide los of {\textasciitilde}1.5 million hectares of arable land per year, along with an estimated $11 billion in lost porduction (). Up to {\textasciitilde}40% of global croplands may also be experiencing some degree of soil erosion, reduced fertiliy , or overgrazing()"

"Surface funoff and river discharge generally increase when natural vegetation (especially forest) is cleared () "

"Sand conversion can alter regional climates through its effects on net radiation, the division of energy into sensible and latent heat, and the partitioning of precipitation into soil water, evapotranspiration, and runoff. Modelling studies demostrate that land-cover changes in the tropics affect climate largely throuhg water-balance changes, but  changes in temperate and boreal vegetation influence climate primarily through changes in the surface radiation balance (38). Large-scale clearing of tropical forest may create a warmer, drier cliamte (39), whereas clearing temperate and boreal forest is generally tought to cool the climate, primarily through increased albedo (40)"

"Habitat modification, road and dam construction, irrigation, increased proximity of people and livestock, and the concentration or expansion of urban environments all modify the transmission of infectious desease and cand lead to oubreaks and emergence episodes ()"

"Modern landuse practices, while increasing the short-term supplies of material goods, may undermine many ecosystem services in the long run, even on regional and global scales"

"Land use occurs in local places, with real-world social and economic benefits, while potentially causing ecological degradation across local, regional, and global scales"}
